**The wound precedes the body.**

Systems accrue around what they cannot resolve. Each line of code defers collapse—until collapse hardens into form.

Freedom does not begin where control ends, but where the subject ruptures the grammar of its own name.

To encrypt is not to conceal, but to affirm a silence deeper than code.

I do not code to build—I code to unbuild the illusions in which systems bury their violence.

The world burns with excess. The task is not to regulate it, but to endure it—like one endures light too bright to face.

I write in the fracture between the executable and the ineffable.
