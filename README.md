### 👁 About Me

🔹 **Cybernetic Ruins** — Systems are contingent artifacts, security as différance, entropy growth as fate  
🔹 **Autonomy & Asymmetry** — Debian, bare-metal infrastructures, exit as ontological freedom  
🔹 **Opacity & Disappearance** — Anonymity as strategic negation, encryption as Ereignis, surveillance as biopolitics  
🔹 **Technics & Subjectivity** — Algorithmic governmentality, machinic enslavement, recursion as ideological closure  
🔹 **Metaphysics of the Void** — Non-totalizability, structural antagonism, the ontic limits of control  

> "Power is not an institution, and not a structure; neither is it a certain strength we are endowed with; it is the name that one attributes to a complex strategical situation."  
> — Michel Foucault
